The 5 Questions
=================================

.. _Should I Use AI/ML?:

Should I use AI/ML?
-------------------

Developing an AI application offers challenges in several areas not present in
typical software engineering projects, for example the areas of data collection,
management, testing, and validation. While there are areas in which the
technology is beneficial it is important to evaluate the repsective costs and
benefits of AI and Machine Learning for the proposed task. To address this,
the first step in this guide is to provide a high level feasibility check of the
key question: should I use AI for my project? We break this question down
into three tasks:

* What is the engineering case for using AI to solve the problem, over other
  approaches? 
* Does the problem involve any application or data areas that may prohibit
  development?

  * What is the risk that the project falls into the unacceptable AI Risk
    category? 
  * What is the risk that the project makes use of problematic data?

.. _How do I define my AI project?:

How do I define my AI project?
------------------------------

In the previous step we developed an engineering case for using AI in our
project. In this step, we start to realize our project by setting the goals and
bounds of the project. There are three parts: 

* Defining goals and metrics for success
* Defining limitations and boundaries on the project
* Completing a risk assessment of the project as a whole

.. _How do I collect data for my AI/ML project?:

How do I collect data for my AI/ML project?
-------------------------------------------

In the previous step, we defined the scope of our project. In this step, we move
on to the first practical engineering task: collecting the data. AI/ML
applications are fundamentally, data driven, so gathering or processing data is
essential. Itâ€™s very important to get this right,  as the quality of the data
will directly impact the success of training and deploying the AI application.
We set out a number of steps for this section, but our primary challenges are: 

* Making sure the data we collect is useful, truthful, and effective.
* Transforming our raw data into a form that can effectively utilized by AI/ML
  algorithms 
* Setting up a robust infrastructure for data collection, storage, and access.

.. _How do I train my AI/ML application?:

How do I train my AI/ML application?
------------------------------------

In the previous step, we collected the data for our AI project. In this step, we
will use it to train an AI algorithm of our choice to meet the goals of our
project. This is a critical step at which issues from earlier decisions may
start to surface, so we recommend reviewing earlier decisions if problems arise.
This step addresses 3 primary challenges: 

* Deciding which AI approach to use
* Engineering a pipeline that optimizes the training
* Ensuring that the training results in an AI algorithm that performs as
  expected and avoids unintended behavior.

.. _How do I deploy my AI application?:

How do I deploy my AI application?
----------------------------------

After training our AI application, we can finally deploy it and (hopefully)
achieve the goals set out in our previous steps. For many professional engineers
his step will feel familiar, as the process for deploying an AI application is
similar to that of deploying any other software application. Our process has
three steps: 

* Preparing our trained the model for a live environment
* Engineering a process for deployment and model updating
* Setting up continuous monitoring to ensure the model performs as expected over
  time
