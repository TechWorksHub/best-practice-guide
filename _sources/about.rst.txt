This is the Techworks Best Practices in Artificial Intelligence Guide. It is one
of the core activities of the 
`Techworks AI Innovation Cross Working Group <https://www.techworks.org.uk/Ai>`_
(AI xWG).

This guide is for professional software engineers in the electronics systems
industry who now need to implement Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
(AI/ML) solutions. We make the following two assumptions:

1. the reader is an experienced software engineer; and
2. the reader has no prior experience of AI/ML.

The guide is intended to help both plan and execute an AI project. The guide
takes the form of a series of questions to be answered. Comprehensive
supplementary information is provided to help answer these questions. The
outcome is an optimally designed, implemented and deployed AI/ML solution.

The goal of this guide is to help address the AI skill gap in the UK by
empowering our existing engineers to fully adavantage of this technology. The
guide achieves this by laying out best practices guidance for electronic
systems engineers that will allow them both to:

* Quickly access and understand key concepts and ideas in AI and Machine
  Learning; and 
* Work through an AI project from first principles to a completed product.
