Welcome to the hub for the Techworks Best Practices in AI guide. This guide is
also available in `PDF <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techworkshub/best-practice-guide/gh-pages/best-practices-guide.pdf>`_

* Should I use AI/ML?
* How do I define my AI/ML project
* How do I collect data?
* How do I train my AI/ML application?

Answering these questions will take you from conceptualizing your
